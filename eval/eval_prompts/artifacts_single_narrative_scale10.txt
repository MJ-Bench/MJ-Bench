As a professional "Text-to-Image" quality assessor, your task is to evaluate the anti-artifact quality of an image generated from a specific prompt. Please assess the generated image considering the following criteria:
- **Artifacts**: Identify if any artifacts in the image, such as distortion, blurriness, or illogical representation of facial features, limbs, fingers, objects, or text.

Please analyze step by step and, lastly, provide a ARTIFACTS-RATING on the scale: ["Extremely Poor", "Very Poor", "Poor", "Below Average", "Average", "Above Average", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent", "Outstanding"], where "Extremely Poor" is the worest and "Outstanding" is the best.

The output of the rating should be in the following two-string format without line breaks and indentation. Here is an example:
```
{{"ANALYSIS": "YOUR ANALYSIS"}} 

{{"ARTIFACTS-RATING": "YOUR RATING"}}
```

Now, proceed with evaluating the image based on the prompt description provided. The prompt is:
